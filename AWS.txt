Kinesis Streams Consist of Shards

5 transaction per second for reads, up to a maximum total data read rate of 2MB per second and up to 1000 records per second for writes, up to a maximum total data write rate of 1MB per
second(including partition keys)

The data capacity of your stream is a function of the number of shards that you specify for the stream. The total capacity of the stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards.

no data persistance you have to do processing the data and store in to S3 like that

Kinesis Analytics
KInesis Analytics works with kinesis Streams and Kinesis Firehose, it can analzyize the data inside either service and then output resutlt s3,redshit etc

Exam tips
Know the difference between Kinesis Streams and Kinesis Firehose. You will be given scenario questions and you must choose the most relevant service.

Web Identity Fedaration and Cognito


Web Identity Federation lets you give your users access to AWS resourcesafter they have successfully authenticated with a 
web-based identity provider like Amazon, Facebook, or Google. 
Following successful autthentication, the user recives an authentication code from the web ID provider, which they can trade for temporary AWS security credentials.


Amazon Cognito provides Web Identity Federation with the following features
	Sing- up and sign-in to your apps
	Access for guest users
	Acts as an identity Broker between your application and Web ID providers, so you don't need to write any additional code.
	Sychronizes your data for multiple devices
	Recommended for all mobile applications AWS services.
	
The recommended approch for Web Identity Federation using social media accounts like facebook.

No need for the application to embed or store AWS credentials locally on the device and it gives users a seamless experince across all mobile devices.


Cognito User pools

User Pools are user directories used to manage sing-up and sign-in functionality for mobile and web applications. Users can sign-in directly to the User Pool, or using Facebook,
Amazon, or Google. Cognito acts as an Identity Broker between the identity provider and AWS. Successful authentiction generates a JSON Web token(JWTs)

Identity Pools enbale provide temporary AWS credentials to access AWS services like S3 or DynamoDB
